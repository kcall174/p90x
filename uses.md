<h3> Usage and Utility </h3>

The project is supposed to be useful for thin, multiple windows, and easily accessible and transferable to mobile. User needs internet, and a browser aside from relevant workout equipment to accomplish their workouts. When I'm about to workout, I simply need a water bottle, and my phone.

<h3> Good for Night Modes and Dark Reader </h3>

For mobile, I prefer Mozilla Firefox's mobile browser with Night Mode on. On computers I prefer <a href="https://darkreader.org/">Dark Reader</a>
