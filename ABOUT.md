<h1> ABOUT </h1>

Hello,

I am very new to coding, with only a few months of python during the Corona Virus Quarantine, and growing up I learned some html to edit my myspace. This is my very first project and was mainly for utlity for me and anyone else that wanted it. I simply wanted everything I needed to complete my workouts in one place, one app, accessible on a computer or a smartphone. The user can see the workout list if they wanted to accomplish the workout without video, and listen to music instead, or the user can watch the videos. I used Archive.org for all of the videos, they accept crypto and cash donations so I ask if you want to donate at all, PLEASE donate to [Archive.org](archive.org/donate/) FIRST at [Archive.org](archive.org/donate/).

<h4> The Mission </h4>
Make P90X completely virtualy, needing only a smart phone with an internet connection to accomplish your workout.

Donate cash or crypto to Archive.org website here: https://archive.org/donate/. Without them, this would have been much more tedious. If you donated to them and still wish to support me as well, then use the links below:
