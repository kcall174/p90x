I am very new to coding. This is my very first project and was mainly for quality of life purposes. I simply wanted everything I needed to complete my workouts in one place, one app, accessible on a computer or a smartphone. The user can see the workout list if they wanted to accomplish the workout without video, and perhaps listen to music instead since most smartphones only accept one audio source at a time, or the user can watch the videos, and have access to the lists or not even use them if they're not needed. I used Archive.org for all of the videos, they accept crypto and cash donations so I ask if you want to donate at all, PLEASE donate to [Archive.org](https://archive.org/donate?origin=iawww-TopNavDonateButton)
